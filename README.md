Project Title: Business Intelligence Solution using Azure Data Stack

Project Motivation:

Every organization today is in a sort of continuous struggle for being different from the rest in the world of business. The use of data analytics for leveraging the identification of areas in improvement is among the best ways of doing so. However, not every organization could be in a position or equipped to apply the full stack of business intelligence (BI) solution within their facilities. Provision of a cost-effective and scalable BI solution using Microsoft Azure technologies will be one of the solutions towards solving this problem during this project.

 Proprietary and Open-Source Business Intelligence Solutions:

•	Azure Data Factory (ADF): ADF will be used to build and manage ETL pipelines—extract, transform, load data from a wide variety of sources—into one single data store in a centralized way. ADF provides a low-code/no-code interface and, as such, it is one of the easiest ways to build and maintain data pipelines with little experience in coding.
•	Azure Databricks: A cloud-based Apache Spark that is meant for use in transforming data, computations, and even feature engineering. Spark is good in dealing with huge data volume since it is a strong distributed computing engine. The user interface provided by the Databricks platform is very friendly and much more integrated with other Azure services, and it suits this project.
•	Power BI: A commonly known business intelligence tool applied to create dashboards and interactive reports in visualization of insights from data. Power BI has various visualization capabilities and can easily be embedded in web applications and portals.
•	CI/CD Pipelines: Develop CI/CD pipelines for deploying the code automatically from the development to production. This will not permit the BI solution to lag time and will mirror the latest changes in data.
•	Azure DevOps: This tool will be helpful in tracking the progression of the project, managing the code repository, and collaborating with members of your team. Azure DevOps is a complete suite of practice tools of DevOps, being capable of managing the project lifecycle; as such, it is perfect.








Target Audience:

•	Small and medium businesses, which do not have the finances to design their own BI solutions out of the blue with a need to keep their BI running.
•	Large enterprises that must upgrade the already implemented rudimentary BI infrastructure.
•	Business analysts, data scientists requiring tools to gain insights from their data. Executives and decision-makers requiring insights in their hands to act and drive effective business decisions. Type of System: The type of system shall be one that will develop a scalable cloud-based BI solution that can be accessed from anywhere and at any time.

Type of System:

•	Modular: The system will be modularly designed, easy to add or remove modules to fit the organizational requirements.
•	Scalable: It is easy to scale the system from minimum use to extreme use.
•	Security: The system will be developed keeping in view security aspects to secure sensitive data.

Project Deliverables:

•	ETL pipelines: This means the formation of pipelines that will help to extract data from various sources to load it into a centralized data store.
•	Data model: A data model will be developed to outline data structures and lay down a plan for how the BI solution shall be deployed over them.
•	Data transformations: All data will be cleaned, prepared, and enriched through data transformations for analysis.
•	Interactive dashboards and reports: Building interactive dashboards and reports that will help visualize the insights obtained through the data.
•	Deployment documentation: Service provides with documentations on how deployments and maintaining the solution is to be done.

Conclusion:

This project aims to provide an affordable and scalable BI solution that will enable organizations to draw insights from their data and make decisions driven by this information. Using Microsoft Azure technologies, the project will deliver a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use solution adaptable to the individual needs of every organization with ease.
